                        <p>Drug abuse is a substance or drug use disorder, is a condition characterized by a self-destructive pattern of using a substance that leads to significant problems and distress, which may include tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance. Drug use disorder is unfortunately quite common, affecting more people at some point in their lives. People can abuse virtually any substance whose consumption can result in a overjoyed ("high") feeling. Inhalants like household cleaners are some of the most commonly abused substances. While the specific physical and psychological effects of drug use disorder tend to vary based on the particular substance involved, the general effects of a substance use disorder involving any drug can be devastating.</h3>
                        <p>Symptoms of a drug abuse include recurrent drug use that results in legal problems which occurs in potentially dangerous situations, interfere with important obligations, results in social or relationship problems, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, using a lot of the drug or for a long period of time, etc. While the specific effects of drugs on the brain can somewhat vary depending on the drug that is being used, virtually every substance that is abused has an effect on the executive-functioning areas of the brain. Drugs particularly affect the brain's ability to inhibit actions that the person would otherwise delay or prevent.
                        	<br>
                        Treatment options for substance abuse disorders remain largely underutilized by most people who suffer from these conditions. The primary goals of recovery are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation.</br></p>
